## Explanation
In this project, I created the qtrain() function and was provided with the Python files for the maze representation and state storage. 

Computer scientists design software to solve many different real world problems. The solutions that they come up with matter since they are the backbone of many useful software applications. To approach a problem as a computer scientist, one should solve the problem before coding it, creating psudocode as they go along to create the final program. Also, they should solve the most general cases and then narrow down the program to its specifics as they go along. Completing a project in these smaller stages along with testing it along the way helps avoid distraction and confusion. Computer scientists hold ethical responsibilities to the end user like making the application accessible in terms of visuals, text, and making sure the app is secure. They also hold ethical responsibilities to their organizations in the same regard with security.
